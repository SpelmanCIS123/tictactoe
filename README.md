# tictactoe-Gameboard

## Instructions: 
- Your mission is to write a program that mimics Tic Tac Toe.  It should be a one-player game against the computer.  

### Rules for TIC-TAC-TOE:
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. ...
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

You must be able to:
- take in moves, 
- display the board as it progresses, and 
- check for (announce) a winner.

['', '', '']<br/>
['', '', '']<br/>
['', '', '']<br/>
